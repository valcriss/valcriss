### 🧠 About Me

With over 25 years of experience, I love building things that solve problems,  whether it's a game for my daughter, a budgeting tool for my household, or a cloud-native pipeline for CI/CD. I’m all about clean code, automation, and making complex things feel simple.

### 🧼 Clean Code, Agile Vibes & Brain Gains

I'm a big fan of the **SOLID principles**,  not just because they sound cool, but because they make code easier to maintain, extend, and enjoy reading (even months later).

I believe in **agile methodologies** that focus on people, feedback, and delivering value fast,  without the post-it overdose. Kindness and collaboration are key, whether it’s in a daily stand-up or a late-night code review.

Above all, I strive to **learn something new every day**, whether it’s a design pattern, a performance trick, or how to fix a Unity camera bug at 2am.

### 🎮 Game Development (Private Projects)

While my game projects aren't public (yet?), they play a huge part in my learning and experimentation:

- **Current solo project**: *Refuge*,  a sandbox survival/management sim where survivors manage an underground shelter after a zombie outbreak.
- **Tech highlights**: custom GOAP AI, isometric camera controls, resource systems, and UI with an event-driven architecture.
- **Bonus side quests**: educational games to help my daughter with math,  fast-paced and fun, never boring drills.
